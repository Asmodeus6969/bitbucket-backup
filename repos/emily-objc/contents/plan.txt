Emily 0.1 - dev

Overall goal:

Emily is a programming language exploring the idea of unifying pattern-matched functions with objects. A description of the planned language is at http://emilylang.org/ .

Current goal:

Create the quickest minimally functioning prototype of a language resembling Emily's intended semantics, so that I can play around with syntax ideas and have a basis for LLVM experiments.

Next steps following current prototype:

- Pull in LLVM so that I can start experimenting with C++ FFI
- Probably want to remove Objective-C, the portability implications can't be good.

Known bad elements of current prototype:

- No TCO
- Emily stack is C stack, so unrolling (say for TCO) will be pretty much impossible
- Overall inefficient
- Spaces are generally ignored by lexer. "& &" is one token, "1 000 000" is one million.
- No attempt has been made to compile on anything but XCode 3.2.6 for OS X
- Known memory leaks
