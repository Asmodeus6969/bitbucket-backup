Here are macros and a server which allow you to write Twine stories with persistent online interactivity. Using this may in practice require either some Linux knowledge or the help of someone who knows Linux (although the server does run on Mac and Windows).

Usage instructions:

* Copy the contents of the file macro/spool_macros.js into a passage in your Twine story named "spool_macros" and with tags "script".

* In a terminal window, cd to the server/ folder and execute
	python server.py
to launch the Tornado web server. Once you have done this, you can access any stories in the server/twine folder in a web browser, for example the file server/twine/test.html can be accessed via:
	http://localhost:8888/test.html
This is necessary; the spool_macros macros will *not* work if you just open them from file:/// or upload them to an ordinary web server.

At your option, you may launch server.py specifying a particular port:
	python server.py --port=33333
Or tack on a --debug=1 argument to see server traffic (see --help).

There is an example story named "test.tws" pre-loaded into the server/twine folder. There is a file with detailed macro usage instructions in macro/usage.txt.
