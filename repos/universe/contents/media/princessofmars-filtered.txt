with my back against a golden throne i fought once again for dejah thoris.he was a splendid specimen of manhood standing a good two inches over six feet broad of shoulder and narrow of hip with the carriage of the trained fighting man.his features were regular and clear cut his hair black and closely cropped while his eyes were of a steel gray reflecting a strong and loyal character filled with fire and initiative.his manners were perfect and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.his horsemanship especially after hounds was a marvel and delight even in that country of magnificent horsemen.i have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness but he would only laugh and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back of a horse yet unfoaled.he told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study telling me i would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity.after i had retired for the night i have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal.i thought at the time that he was praying although i never understood that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.for some reason this news did not surprise me but i hurried out to his place as quickly as possible so that i could take charge of the body and of his affairs.i found the watchman who had discovered him together with the local police chief and several townspeople assembled in his little study.the watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the body which he said had been still warm when he came upon it.it lay he said stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched above the head toward the edge of the bluff and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where i had seen him on those other nights with his arms raised in supplication to the skies.he directed that i remove his body to virginia without embalming and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which as i later learned was well ventilated.the instructions impressed upon me that i must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed even in secrecy if necessary.i sought out dejah thoris in the throng of departing chariots.she drew upon the marble floor the first map of the barsoomian territory i had ever seen.the old man sat and talked with me for hours.as our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us must return to civilization purchase the necessary machinery and return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine.as powell was familiar with the country as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip.it was agreed that i was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector.some half hour later i happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place i had last seen my friend and his two pack animals.i am not given to needless worrying but the more i tried to convince myself that all was well with powell and that the dots i had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses the less i was able to assure myself.since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile indian and we had therefore become careless in the extreme and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches.as soon as i reached comparatively level ground i urged my mount into a canter and continued this where the going permitted until close upon dusk i discovered the point where other tracks joined those of powell.they were the tracks of unshod ponies three of them and the ponies had been galloping.i was positive now that the trailers were apaches and that they wished to capture powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture so i urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace hoping against hope that i would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me.i knew that powell would need me now if ever and i instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail.i had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small open plateau near the summit of the pass.i had passed through a narrow overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay.the little stretch of level land was white with indian tepees and there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some object near the center of the camp.their attention was so wholly riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me and i easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and made my escape with perfect safety.the fact however that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me.i do not believe that i am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes because in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death i cannot recall a single one where any alternative step to that i took occurred to me until many hours later.my mind is evidently so constituted that i am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes.however that may be i have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me.in this instance i was of course positive that powell was the center of attraction but whether i thought or acted first i do not know but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view i had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors shooting rapidly and whooping at the top of my lungs.singlehanded i could not have pursued better tactics for the red men convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars was upon them turned and fled in every direction for their bows arrows and rifles.the view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with apprehension and with rage.under the clear rays of the arizona moon lay powell his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the braves.that he was already dead i could not but be convinced and yet i would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the apaches as quickly as i would have saved the man himself from death.riding close to him i reached down from the saddle and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount.a backward glance convinced me that to return by the way i had come would be more hazardous than to continue across the plateau so putting spurs to my poor beast i made a dash for the opening to the pass which i could distinguish on the far side of the table land.the indians had by this time discovered that i was alone and i was pursued with imprecations arrows and rifle balls.the fact that it is difficult to aim anything but imprecations accurately by moonlight that they were upset by the sudden and unexpected manner of my advent and that i was a rather rapidly moving target saved me from the various deadly projectiles of the enemy and permitted me to reach the shadows of the surrounding peaks before an orderly pursuit could be organized.my horse was traveling practically unguided as i knew that i had probably less knowledge of the exact location of the trail to the pass than he and thus it happened that he entered a defile which led to the summit of the range and not to the pass which i had hoped would carry me to the valley and to safety.it is probable however that to this fact i owe my life and the remarkable experiences and adventures which befell me during the following ten years.my first knowledge that i was on the wrong trail came when i heard the yells of the pursuing savages suddenly grow fainter and fainter far off to my left.i knew then that they had passed to the left of the jagged rock formation at the edge of the plateau to the right of which my horse had borne me and the body of powell.i drew rein on a little level promontory overlooking the trail below and to my left and saw the party of pursuing savages disappearing around the point of a neighboring peak.i knew the indians would soon discover that they were on the wrong trail and that the search for me would be renewed in the right direction as soon as they located my tracks.i had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an excellent trail opened up around the face of a high cliff.the trail was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction i wished to go.the cliff arose for several hundred feet on my right and on my left was an equal and nearly perpendicular drop to the bottom of a rocky ravine.i had followed this trail for perhaps a hundred yards when a sharp turn to the right brought me to the mouth of a large cave.the opening was about four feet in height and three to four feet wide and at this opening the trail ended.it was now morning and with the customary lack of dawn which is a startling characteristic of arizona it had become daylight almost without warning.dismounting i laid powell upon the ground but the most painstaking examination failed to reveal the faintest spark of life.i forced water from my canteen between his dead lips bathed his face and rubbed his hands working over him continuously for the better part of an hour in the face of the fact that i knew him to be dead.as i was continuing my examination i commenced to feel a pleasant drowsiness creeping over me which i attributed to the fatigue of my long and strenuous ride and the reaction from the excitement of the fight and the pursuit.i felt comparatively safe in my present location as i knew that one man could defend the trail to the cave against an army.a sense of delicious dreaminess overcame me my muscles relaxed and i was on the point of giving way to my desire to sleep when the sound of approaching horses reached my ears.i attempted to spring to my feet but was horrified to discover that my muscles refused to respond to my will.i was now thoroughly awake but as unable to move a muscle as though turned to stone.it was then for the first time that i noticed a slight vapor filling the cave.it was extremely tenuous and only noticeable against the opening which led to daylight.there also came to my nostrils a faintly pungent odor and i could only assume that i had been overcome by some poisonous gas but why i should retain my mental faculties and yet be unable to move i could not fathom.i lay facing the opening of the cave and where i could see the short stretch of trail which lay between the cave and the turn of the cliff around which the trail led.the noise of the approaching horses had ceased and i judged the indians were creeping stealthily upon me along the little ledge which led to my living tomb.i remember that i hoped they would make short work of me as i did not particularly relish the thought of the innumerable things they might do to me if the spirit prompted them.several times i thought i heard faint sounds behind me as of somebody moving cautiously but eventually even these ceased and i was left to the contemplation of my position without interruption.i could but vaguely conjecture the cause of my paralysis and my only hope lay in that it might pass off as suddenly as it had fallen upon me.late in the afternoon my horse which had been standing with dragging rein before the cave started slowly down the trail evidently in search of food and water and i was left alone with my mysterious unknown companion and the dead body of my friend which lay just within my range of vision upon the ledge where i had placed it in the early morning.again was i suddenly recalled to my immediate surroundings by a repetition of the weird moan from the depths of the cave.naked and unarmed as i was i had no desire to face the unseen thing which menaced me.my revolvers were strapped to my lifeless body which for some unfathomable reason i could not bring myself to touch.my carbine was in its boot strapped to my saddle and as my horse had wandered off i was left without means of defense.my only alternative seemed to lie in flight and my decision was crystallized by a recurrence of the rustling sound from the thing which now seemed in the darkness of the cave and to my distorted imagination to be creeping stealthily upon me.i found myself lying prone upon a bed of yellowish mosslike vegetation which stretched around me in all directions for interminable miles.i seemed to be lying in a deep circular basin along the outer verge of which i could distinguish the irregularities of low hills.springing to my feet i received my first martian surprise for the effort which on earth would have brought me standing upright carried me into the martian air to the height of about three yards.i alighted softly upon the ground however without appreciable shock or jar.now commenced a series of evolutions which even then seemed ludicrous in the extreme.i found that i must learn to walk all over again as the muscular exertion which carried me easily and safely upon earth played strange antics with me upon mars.instead of progressing in a sane and dignified manner my attempts to walk resulted in a variety of hops which took me clear of the ground a couple of feet at each step and landed me sprawling upon my face or back at the end of each second or third hop.my muscles perfectly attuned and accustomed to the force of gravity on earth played the mischief with me in attempting for the first time to cope with the lesser gravitation and lower air pressure on mars.i was determined however to explore the low structure which was the only evidence of habitation in sight and so i hit upon the unique plan of reverting to first principles in locomotion creeping.i did fairly well at this and in a few moments had reached the low encircling wall of the enclosure.there appeared to be no doors or windows upon the side nearest me but as the wall was but about four feet high i cautiously gained my feet and peered over the top upon the strangest sight it had ever been given me to see.five or six had already hatched and the grotesque caricatures which sat blinking in the sunlight were enough to cause me to doubt my sanity.they seemed mostly head with little scrawny bodies long necks and six legs or as i afterward learned two legs and two arms with an intermediary pair of limbs which could be used at will either as arms or legs.their eyes were set at the extreme sides of their heads a trifle above the center and protruded in such a manner that they could be directed either forward or back and also independently of each other thus permitting this queer animal to look in any direction or in two directions at once without the necessity of turning the head.the iris of the eyes is blood red as in albinos while the pupil is dark.the eyeball itself is very white as are the teeth.these latter add a most ferocious appearance to an otherwise fearsome and terrible countenance as the lower tusks curve upward to sharp points which end about where the eyes of earthly human beings are located.the whiteness of the teeth is not that of ivory but of the snowiest and most gleaming of china.against the dark background of their olive skins their tusks stand out in a most striking manner making these weapons present a singularly formidable appearance.coming as they did over the soft and soundless moss which covers practically the entire surface of mars with the exception of the frozen areas at the poles and the scattered cultivated districts they might have captured me easily but their intentions were far more sinister.it was the rattling of the accouterments of the foremost warrior which warned me.unarmed and naked as i was the first law of nature manifested itself in the only possible solution of my immediate problem and that was to get out of the vicinity of the point of the charging spear.consequently i gave a very earthly and at the same time superhuman leap to reach the top of the martian incubator for such i had determined it must be.my effort was crowned with a success which appalled me no less than it seemed to surprise the martian warriors for it carried me fully thirty feet into the air and landed me a hundred feet from my pursuers and on the opposite side of the enclosure.i alighted upon the soft moss easily and without mishap and turning saw my enemies lined up along the further wall.some were surveying me with expressions which i afterward discovered marked extreme astonishment and the others were evidently satisfying themselves that i had not molested their young.my feat then was as marvelous upon mars as it would have been upon earth and from desiring to annihilate me they suddenly looked upon me as a wonderful discovery to be captured and exhibited among their fellows.the respite my unexpected agility had given me permitted me to formulate plans for the immediate future and to note more closely the appearance of the warriors for i could not disassociate these people in my mind from those other warriors who only the day before had been pursuing me.i noted that each was armed with several other weapons in addition to the huge spear which i have described.the weapon which caused me to decide against an attempt at escape by flight was what was evidently a rifle of some description and which i felt for some reason they were peculiarly efficient in handling.these rifles were of a white metal stocked with wood which i learned later was a very light and intensely hard growth much prized on mars and entirely unknown to us denizens of earth.the metal of the barrel is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with which we are familiar.the weight of these rifles is comparatively little and with the small caliber explosive radium projectiles which they use and the great length of the barrel they are deadly in the extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on earth.the theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles but the best they can do in actual service when equipped with their wireless finders and sighters is but a trifle over two hundred miles.the martians after conversing for a short time turned and rode away in the direction from which they had come leaving one of their number alone by the enclosure.when they had covered perhaps two hundred yards they halted and turning their mounts toward us sat watching the warrior by the enclosure.he was the one whose spear had so nearly transfixed me and was evidently the leader of the band as i had noted that they seemed to have moved to their present position at his direction.when his force had come to a halt he dismounted threw down his spear and small arms and came around the end of the incubator toward me entirely unarmed and as naked as i except for the ornaments strapped upon his head limbs and breast.placing my hand over my heart i bowed low to the martian and explained to him that while i did not understand his language his actions spoke for the peace and friendship that at the present moment were most dear to my heart.of course i might have been a babbling brook for all the intelligence my speech carried to him but he understood the action with which i immediately followed my words.the entire cavalcade then turned and galloped away toward the range of hills in the distance.in a short time we gained the foot of the mountains and after traversing a narrow gorge came to an open valley at the far extremity of which was a low table land upon which i beheld an enormous city.toward this we galloped entering it by what appeared to be a ruined roadway leading out from the city but only to the edge of the table land where it ended abruptly in a flight of broad steps.upon closer observation i saw as we passed them that the buildings were deserted and while not greatly decayed had the appearance of not having been tenanted for years possibly for ages.toward the center of the city was a large plaza and upon this and in the buildings immediately surrounding it were camped some nine or ten hundred creatures of the same breed as my captors for such i now considered them despite the suave manner in which i had been trapped.i saw no signs of extreme age among them nor is there any appreciable difference in their appearance from the age of maturity about forty until at about the age of one thousand years they go voluntarily upon their last strange pilgrimage down the river iss which leads no living martian knows whither and from whose bosom no martian has ever returned or would be allowed to live did he return after once embarking upon its cold dark waters.there are other and natural causes tending toward a diminution of population but nothing contributes so greatly to this end as the fact that no male or female martian is ever voluntarily without a weapon of destruction.as we neared the plaza and my presence was discovered we were immediately surrounded by hundreds of the creatures who seemed anxious to pluck me from my seat behind my guard.a word from the leader of the party stilled their clamor and we proceeded at a trot across the plaza to the entrance of as magnificent an edifice as mortal eye has rested upon.the building was low but covered an enormous area.it was constructed of gleaming white marble inlaid with gold and brilliant stones which sparkled and scintillated in the sunlight.the main entrance was some hundred feet in width and projected from the building proper to form a huge canopy above the entrance hall.there was no stairway but a gentle incline to the first floor of the building opened into an enormous chamber encircled by galleries.our party had halted at the entrance to the building and at a sign from the leader i had been lowered to the ground.again locking his arm in mine we had proceeded into the audience chamber.there were few formalities observed in approaching the martian chieftain.my captor merely strode up to the rostrum the others making way for him as he advanced.the chieftain rose to his feet and uttered the name of my escort who in turn halted and repeated the name of the ruler followed by his title.the ideas of humor among the green men of mars are widely at variance with our conceptions of incitants to merriment.the death agonies of a fellow being are to these strange creatures provocative of the wildest hilarity while their chief form of commonest amusement is to inflict death on their prisoners of war in various ingenious and horrible ways.the assembled warriors and chieftains examined me closely feeling my muscles and the texture of my skin.the principal chieftain then evidently signified a desire to see me perform and motioning me to follow he started with tars tarkas for the open plaza.my fears were groundless however as the other martians at first struck dumb with wonderment finally broke into wild peals of laughter and applause.i did not recognize the applause as such but later when i had become acquainted with their customs i learned that i had won what they seldom accord a manifestation of approbation.tars tarkas and the chief exchanged a few words and the former calling to a young female among the throng gave her some instructions and motioned me to accompany her.i grasped her proffered arm and together we crossed the plaza toward a large building on the far side.sola motioned me to be seated upon a pile of silks near the center of the room and turning made a peculiar hissing sound as though signaling to someone in an adjoining room.in response to her call i obtained my first sight of a new martian wonder.it waddled in on its ten short legs and squatted down before the girl like an obedient puppy.the thing was about the size of a shetland pony but its head bore a slight resemblance to that of a frog except that the jaws were equipped with three rows of long sharp tusks.while i was allowing my fancy to run riot in wild conjecture on the possible explanation of the strange anomalies which i had so far met with on mars sola returned bearing both food and drink.these she placed on the floor beside me and seating herself a short ways off regarded me intently.the food consisted of about a pound of some solid substance of the consistency of cheese and almost tasteless while the liquid was apparently milk from some animal.it was not unpleasant to the taste though slightly acid and i learned in a short time to prize it very highly.it came as i later discovered not from an animal as there is only one mammal on mars and that one very rare indeed but from a large plant which grows practically without water but seems to distill its plentiful supply of milk from the products of the soil the moisture of the air and the rays of the sun.a single plant of this species will give eight or ten quarts of milk per day.after i had eaten i was greatly invigorated but feeling the need of rest i stretched out upon the silks and was soon asleep.i must have slept several hours as it was dark when i awoke and i was very cold.i noticed that someone had thrown a fur over me but it had become partially dislodged and in the darkness i could not see to replace it.suddenly a hand reached out and pulled the fur over me shortly afterwards adding another to my covering.i have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone.it therefore now occurred to me that the surest way of learning the exact attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room.i felt fairly secure in my belief that i could escape him should he pursue me once i was outside the building for i had begun to take great pride in my ability as a jumper.furthermore i could see from the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper and probably no runner.evidently his mission was to protect me only i thought but when we reached the edge of the city he suddenly sprang before me uttering strange sounds and baring his ugly and ferocious tusks.thinking to have some amusement at his expense i rushed toward him and when almost upon him sprang into the air alighting far beyond him and away from the city.he wheeled instantly and charged me with the most appalling speed i had ever beheld.i had thought his short legs a bar to swiftness but had he been coursing with greyhounds the latter would have appeared as though asleep on a door mat.as i was to learn this is the fleetest animal on mars and owing to its intelligence loyalty and ferocity is used in hunting in war and as the protector of the martian man.i quickly saw that i would have difficulty in escaping the fangs of the beast on a straightaway course and so i met his charge by doubling in my tracks and leaping over him as he was almost upon me.this maneuver gave me a considerable advantage and i was able to reach the city quite a bit ahead of him and as he came tearing after me i jumped for a window about thirty feet from the ground in the face of one of the buildings overlooking the valley.the thing which more nearly resembled our earthly men than it did the martians i had seen held me pinioned to the ground with one huge foot while it jabbered and gesticulated at some answering creature behind me.this other which was evidently its mate soon came toward us bearing a mighty stone cudgel with which it evidently intended to brain me.suddenly i came to myself and with that strange instinct which seems ever to prompt me to my duty i seized the cudgel which had fallen to the floor at the commencement of the battle and swinging it with all the power of my earthly arms i crashed it full upon the head of the ape crushing his skull as though it had been an eggshell.in the instant that these thoughts passed through my mind i had turned to make for the window but my eyes alighting on the form of my erstwhile guardian threw all thoughts of flight to the four winds.he lay gasping upon the floor of the chamber his great eyes fastened upon me in what seemed a pitiful appeal for protection.i could not withstand that look nor could i on second thought have deserted my rescuer without giving as good an account of myself in his behalf as he had in mine.without more ado therefore i turned to meet the charge of the infuriated bull ape.he was now too close upon me for the cudgel to prove of any effective assistance so i merely threw it as heavily as i could at his advancing bulk.it struck him just below the knees eliciting a howl of pain and rage and so throwing him off his balance that he lunged full upon me with arms wide stretched to ease his fall.again as on the preceding day i had recourse to earthly tactics and swinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin i followed it with a smashing left to the pit of his stomach.the effect was marvelous for as i lightly sidestepped after delivering the second blow he reeled and fell upon the floor doubled up with pain and gasping for wind.leaping over his prostrate body i seized the cudgel and finished the monster before he could regain his feet.as i delivered the blow a low laugh rang out behind me and turning i beheld tars tarkas sola and three or four warriors standing in the doorway of the chamber.as my eyes met theirs i was for the second time the recipient of their zealously guarded applause.my absence had been noted by sola on her awakening and she had quickly informed tars tarkas who had set out immediately with a handful of warriors to search for me.as they had approached the limits of the city they had witnessed the actions of the bull ape as he bolted into the building frothing with rage.sola who had accompanied the searching party of her own volition was the only one of the martians whose face had not been twisted in laughter as i battled for my life.she on the contrary was sober with apparent solicitude and as soon as i had finished the monster rushed to me and carefully examined my body for possible wounds or injuries.satisfying herself that i had come off unscathed she smiled quietly and taking my hand started toward the door of the chamber.tars tarkas and the other warriors had entered and were standing over the now rapidly reviving brute which had saved my life and whose life i in turn had rescued.they seemed to be deep in argument and finally one of them addressed me but remembering my ignorance of his language turned back to tars tarkas who with a word and gesture gave some command to the fellow and turned to follow us from the room.there seemed something menacing in their attitude toward my beast and i hesitated to leave until i had learned the outcome.it was well i did so for the warrior drew an evil looking pistol from its holster and was on the point of putting an end to the creature when i sprang forward and struck up his arm.the bullet striking the wooden casing of the window exploded blowing a hole completely through the wood and masonry.the chariots themselves were large commodious and gorgeously decorated.in each was seated a female martian loaded with ornaments of metal with jewels and silks and furs and upon the back of each of the beasts which drew the chariots was perched a young martian driver.like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted the heavier draft animals wore neither bit nor bridle but were guided entirely by telepathic means.this power is wonderfully developed in all martians and accounts largely for the simplicity of their language and the relatively few spoken words exchanged even in long conversations.it is the universal language of mars through the medium of which the higher and lower animals of this world of paradoxes are able to communicate to a greater or less extent depending upon the intellectual sphere of the species and the development of the individual.i was soon appraised of the subject of their conversation as calling to sola tars tarkas signed for her to send me to him.i had by this time mastered the intricacies of walking under martian conditions and quickly responding to his command i advanced to the side of the incubator where the warriors stood.as i reached their side a glance showed me that all but a very few eggs had hatched the incubator being fairly alive with the hideous little devils.they ranged in height from three to four feet and were moving restlessly about the enclosure as though searching for food.i saw that the ceremony if it could be dignified by such a name was over and seeking out sola i found her in our chariot with a hideous little creature held tightly in her arms.the work of rearing young green martians consists solely in teaching them to talk and to use the weapons of warfare with which they are loaded down from the very first year of their lives.coming from eggs in which they have lain for five years the period of incubation they step forth into the world perfectly developed except in size.entirely unknown to their mothers who in turn would have difficulty in pointing out the fathers with any degree of accuracy they are the common children of the community and their education devolves upon the females who chance to capture them as they leave the incubator.i do not mean that the adult martians are unnecessarily or intentionally cruel to the young but theirs is a hard and pitiless struggle for existence upon a dying planet the natural resources of which have dwindled to a point where the support of each additional life means an added tax upon the community into which it is thrown.by careful selection they rear only the hardiest specimens of each species and with almost supernatural foresight they regulate the birth rate to merely offset the loss by death.the incubators are built in remote fastnesses where there is little or no likelihood of their being discovered by other tribes.the result of such a catastrophe would mean no children in the community for another five years.i was later to witness the results of the discovery of an alien incubator.as the incubator had been placed far north of their own territory in a supposedly uninhabited and unfrequented area we had before us a tremendous journey concerning which i of course knew nothing.after our return to the dead city i passed several days in comparative idleness.on the day following our return all the warriors had ridden forth early in the morning and had not returned until just before darkness fell.as i later learned they had been to the subterranean vaults in which the eggs were kept and had transported them to the incubator which they had then walled up for another five years and which in all probability would not be visited again during that period.the vaults which hid the eggs until they were ready for the incubator were located many miles south of the incubator and would be visited yearly by the council of twenty chieftains.why they did not arrange to build their vaults and incubators nearer home has always been a mystery to me and like many other martian mysteries unsolved and unsolvable by earthly reasoning and customs.what surprised sola most in me was that while i could catch telepathic messages easily from others and often when they were not intended for me no one could read a jot from my mind under any circumstances.at first this vexed me but later i was very glad of it as it gave me an undoubted advantage over the martians.the third day after the incubator ceremony we set forth toward home but scarcely had the head of the procession debouched into the open ground before the city than orders were given for an immediate and hasty return.as though trained for years in this particular evolution the green martians melted like mist into the spacious doorways of the nearby buildings until in less than three minutes the entire cavalcade of chariots mastodons and mounted warriors was nowhere to be seen.each carried a strange banner swung from stem to stern above the upper works and upon the prow of each was painted some odd device that gleamed in the sunlight and showed plainly even at the distance at which we were from the vessels.i could see figures crowding the forward decks and upper works of the air craft.whether they had discovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city i could not say but in any event they received a rude reception for suddenly and without warning the green martian warriors fired a terrific volley from the windows of the buildings facing the little valley across which the great ships were so peacefully advancing.twenty minutes after the first volley the great fleet swung trailing off in the direction from which it had first appeared.several of the craft were limping perceptibly and seemed but barely under the control of their depleted crews.their fire had ceased entirely and all their energies seemed focused upon escape.our warriors then rushed up to the roofs of the buildings which we occupied and followed the retreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire.one by one however the ships managed to dip below the crests of the outlying hills until only one barely moving craft was in sight.this had received the brunt of our fire and seemed to be entirely unmanned as not a moving figure was visible upon her decks.slowly she swung from her course circling back toward us in an erratic and pitiful manner.instantly the warriors ceased firing for it was quite apparent that the vessel was entirely helpless and far from being in a position to inflict harm upon us she could not even control herself sufficiently to escape.as she neared the city the warriors rushed out upon the plain to meet her but it was evident that she still was too high for them to hope to reach her decks.from my vantage point in the window i could see the bodies of her crew strewn about although i could not make out what manner of creatures they might be.not a sign of life was manifest upon her as she drifted slowly with the light breeze in a southeasterly direction.she was drifting some fifty feet above the ground followed by all but some hundred of the warriors who had been ordered back to the roofs to cover the possibility of a return of the fleet or of reinforcements.it soon became evident that she would strike the face of the buildings about a mile south of our position and as i watched the progress of the chase i saw a number of warriors gallop ahead dismount and enter the building she seemed destined to touch.as the craft neared the building and just before she struck the martian warriors swarmed upon her from the windows and with their great spears eased the shock of the collision and in a few moments they had thrown out grappling hooks and the big boat was being hauled to ground by their fellows below.after making her fast they swarmed the sides and searched the vessel from stem to stern.i could see them examining the dead sailors evidently for signs of life and presently a party of them appeared from below dragging a little figure among them.the creature was considerably less than half as tall as the green martian warriors and from my balcony i could see that it walked erect upon two legs and surmised that it was some new and strange martian monstrosity with which i had not as yet become acquainted.they removed their prisoner to the ground and then commenced a systematic rifling of the vessel.this operation required several hours during which time a number of the chariots were requisitioned to transport the loot which consisted in arms ammunition silks furs jewels strangely carved stone vessels and a quantity of solid foods and liquids including many casks of water the first i had seen since my advent upon mars.after the last load had been removed the warriors made lines fast to the craft and towed her far out into the valley in a southwesterly direction.a few of them then boarded her and were busily engaged in what appeared from my distant position as the emptying of the contents of various carboys upon the dead bodies of the sailors and over the decks and works of the vessel.this operation concluded they hastily clambered over her sides sliding down the guy ropes to the ground.the last warrior to leave the deck turned and threw something back upon the vessel waiting an instant to note the outcome of his act.as a faint spurt of flame rose from the point where the missile struck he swung over the side and was quickly upon the ground.scarcely had he alighted than the guy ropes were simultaneous released and the great warship lightened by the removal of the loot soared majestically into the air her decks and upper works a mass of roaring flames.lorquas ptomel was too astute an old warrior to be caught upon the open plains with a caravan of chariots and children and so we remained at the deserted city until the danger seemed passed.and the sight which met my eyes was that of a slender girlish figure similar in every detail to the earthly women of my past life.she did not see me at first but just as she was disappearing through the portal of the building which was to be her prison she turned and her eyes met mine.her face was oval and beautiful in the extreme her every feature was finely chiseled and exquisite her eyes large and lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black waving hair caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure.her skin was of a light reddish copper color against which the crimson glow of her cheeks and the ruby of her beautifully molded lips shone with a strangely enhancing effect.as i reached the doorway of our building a strange surprise awaited me.a warrior approached bearing the arms ornaments and full accouterments of his kind.these he presented to me with a few unintelligible words and a bearing at once respectful and menacing.later sola with the aid of several of the other women remodeled the trappings to fit my lesser proportions and after they completed the work i went about garbed in all the panoply of war.from then on sola instructed me in the mysteries of the various weapons and with the martian young i spent several hours each day practicing upon the plaza.i was not yet proficient with all the weapons but my great familiarity with similar earthly weapons made me an unusually apt pupil and i progressed in a very satisfactory manner.i had observed on the two occasions when i had seen her that the prisoner exchanged words with her guards and this convinced me that they spoke or at least could make themselves understood by a common language.with this added incentive i nearly drove sola distracted by my importunities to hasten on my education and within a few more days i had mastered the martian tongue sufficiently well to enable me to carry on a passable conversation and to fully understand practically all that i heard.at this time our sleeping quarters were occupied by three or four females and a couple of the recently hatched young beside sola and her youthful ward myself and woola the hound.after they had retired for the night it was customary for the adults to carry on a desultory conversation for a short time before lapsing into sleep and now that i could understand their language i was always a keen listener although i never proffered any remarks myself.sarkoja and the other women grunted angrily at this evidence of weakness on the part of sola.i decided that at the first opportunity i would take sola into my confidence and openly ask her to aid me and with this resolution strong upon me i turned among my silks and furs and slept the dreamless and refreshing sleep of mars.on this morning i had chosen a new street to explore when suddenly i found myself at the limits of the city.before me were low hills pierced by narrow and inviting ravines.i longed to explore the country before me and like the pioneer stock from which i sprang to view what the landscape beyond the encircling hills might disclose from the summits which shut out my view.as i approached the boundary line woola ran anxiously before me and thrust his body against my legs.his expression was pleading rather than ferocious nor did he bare his great tusks or utter his fearful guttural warnings.denied the friendship and companionship of my kind i had developed considerable affection for woola and sola for the normal earthly man must have some outlet for his natural affections and so i decided upon an appeal to a like instinct in this great brute sure that i would not be disappointed.seeing that the prisoner seemed the center of attraction i halted to view the proceedings.i had not long to wait for presently lorquas ptomel and his retinue of chieftains approached the building and signing the guards to follow with the prisoner entered the audience chamber.realizing that i was a somewhat favored character and also convinced that the warriors did not know of my proficiency in their language as i had pleaded with sola to keep this a secret on the grounds that i did not wish to be forced to talk with the men until i had perfectly mastered the martian tongue i chanced an attempt to enter the audience chamber and listen to the proceedings.lorquas ptomel and the warriors sat looking silently and intently at the young woman for several moments after she had ceased speaking.what was passing in their minds no man may know but that they were moved i truly believe and if one man high among them had been strong enough to rise above custom that moment would have marked a new and mighty era for mars.what words of moment were to have fallen from his lips were never spoken as just then a young warrior evidently sensing the trend of thought among the older men leaped down from the steps of the rostrum and striking the frail captive a powerful blow across the face which felled her to the floor placed his foot upon her prostrate form and turning toward the assembled council broke into peals of horrid mirthless laughter.that i have taken moments to write down a part of what occurred as that blow fell does not signify that i remained inactive for any such length of time.i think i must have sensed something of what was coming for i realize now that i was crouched as for a spring as i saw the blow aimed at her beautiful upturned pleading face and ere the hand descended i was halfway across the hall.dejah thoris had raised herself upon one elbow and was watching the battle with wide staring eyes.when i had regained my feet i raised her in my arms and bore her to one of the benches at the side of the room.we were interrupted at this juncture by the approach of one of the warriors bearing arms accouterments and ornaments and in a flash one of her questions was answered and a puzzle cleared up for me.i saw that the body of my dead antagonist had been stripped and i read in the menacing yet respectful attitude of the warrior who had brought me these trophies of the kill the same demeanor as that evinced by the other who had brought me my original equipment and now for the first time i realized that my blow on the occasion of my first battle in the audience chamber had resulted in the death of my adversary.ordinarily i am not given to long speeches nor ever before had i descended to bombast but i had guessed at the keynote which would strike an answering chord in the breasts of the green martians nor was i wrong for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them and their attitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful.my threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to dejah thoris for as i learned later men do not kill women upon mars nor women men.so sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us.sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand and slung across my shoulder.i laughed and changed the subject.i had no particular desire to kill lorquas ptomel and less to be a jed among the tharks.we decided to use this room on the second floor and overlooking the plaza for dejah thoris and sola and another room adjoining and in the rear for the cooking and supplies.i then dispatched sola to bring the bedding and such food and utensils as she might need telling her that i would guard dejah thoris until her return.as sola departed dejah thoris turned to me with a faint smile.she gazed at me with troubled eyes long and questioningly.that it was difficult to believe my statement i well knew nor could i hope that she would do so however much i craved her confidence and respect.i would much rather not have told her anything of my antecedents but no man could look into the depth of those eyes and refuse her slightest behest.she smiled again as one might in bored indulgence of a questioning child.i then narrated the details of my departure from the earth explaining that my body there lay fully clothed in all the to her strange garments of mundane dwellers.at this point sola returned with our meager belongings and her young martian protege who of course would have to share the quarters with them.sola asked us if we had had a visitor during her absence and seemed much surprised when we answered in the negative.it seemed that as she had mounted the approach to the upper floors where our quarters were located she had met sarkoja descending.we decided that she must have been eavesdropping but as we could recall nothing of importance that had passed between us we dismissed the matter as of little consequence merely promising ourselves to be warned to the utmost caution in the future.dejah thoris and i then fell to examining the architecture and decorations of the beautiful chambers of the building we were occupying.she told me that these people had presumably flourished over a hundred thousand years before.they were the early progenitors of her race but had mixed with the other great race of early martians who were very dark almost black and also with the reddish yellow race which had flourished at the same time.these three great divisions of the higher martians had been forced into a mighty alliance as the drying up of the martian seas had compelled them to seek the comparatively few and always diminishing fertile areas and to defend themselves under new conditions of life against the wild hordes of green men.these ancient martians had been a highly cultivated and literary race but during the vicissitudes of those trying centuries of readjustment to new conditions not only did their advancement and production cease entirely but practically all their archives records and literature were lost.we had been so engrossed in exploration of the building and in our conversation that it was late in the afternoon before we realized it.we were brought back to a realization of our present conditions by a messenger bearing a summons from lorquas ptomel directing me to appear before him forthwith.bidding dejah thoris and sola farewell and commanding woola to remain on guard i hastened to the audience chamber where i found lorquas ptomel and tars tarkas seated upon the rostrum.however instead of putting thoughts of possible escape from my mind my audience with lorquas ptomel only served to center my every faculty on this subject.now more than before the absolute necessity for escape in so far as dejah thoris was concerned was impressed upon me for i was convinced that some horrible fate awaited her at the headquarters of tal hajus.the thought that the divine dejah thoris might fall into the clutches of such an abysmal atavism started the cold sweat upon me.far better that we save friendly bullets for ourselves at the last moment as did those brave frontier women of my lost land who took their own lives rather than fall into the hands of the indian braves.as i wandered about the plaza lost in my gloomy forebodings tars tarkas approached me on his way from the audience chamber.his demeanor toward me was unchanged and he greeted me as though we had not just parted a few moments before.i thanked him but assured him that i could get along very nicely without assistance except in the matter of preparing food and so he promised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care of my arms and the manufacture of my ammunition which he said would be necessary.i suggested that they might also bring some of the sleeping silks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat for the nights were cold and i had none of my own.he promised to do so and departed.left alone i ascended the winding corridor to the upper floors in search of suitable quarters.the beauties of the other buildings were repeated in this and as usual i was soon lost in a tour of investigation and discovery.i finally chose a front room on the third floor because this brought me nearer to dejah thoris whose apartment was on the second floor of the adjoining building and it flashed upon me that i could rig up some means of communication whereby she might signal me in case she needed either my services or my protection.adjoining my sleeping apartment were baths dressing rooms and other sleeping and living apartments in all some ten rooms on this floor.the windows of the back rooms overlooked an enormous court which formed the center of the square made by the buildings which faced the four contiguous streets and which was now given over to the quartering of the various animals belonging to the warriors occupying the adjoining buildings.my thoughts were cut short by the advent of several young females bearing loads of weapons silks furs jewels cooking utensils and casks of food and drink including considerable loot from the air craft.all this it seemed had been the property of the two chieftains i had slain and now by the customs of the tharks it had become mine.at my direction they placed the stuff in one of the back rooms and then departed only to return with a second load which they advised me constituted the balance of my goods.on the second trip they were accompanied by ten or fifteen other women and youths who it seemed formed the retinues of the two chieftains.in theory it may sound well as is often the case with theories but the results of ages of this unnatural practice coupled with the community interest in the offspring being held paramount to that of the mother is shown in the cold cruel creatures and their gloomy loveless mirthless existence.finding that i must assume responsibility for these creatures whether i would or not i made the best of it and directed them to find quarters on the upper floors leaving the third floor to me.one of the girls i charged with the duties of my simple cuisine and directed the others to take up the various activities which had formerly constituted their vocations.thereafter i saw little of them nor did i care to.during our period of inactivity tars tarkas had instructed me in many of the customs and arts of war familiar to the tharks including lessons in riding and guiding the great beasts which bore the warriors.these creatures which are known as thoats are as dangerous and vicious as their masters but when once subdued are sufficiently tractable for the purposes of the green martians.two of these animals had fallen to me from the warriors whose metal i wore and in a short time i could handle them quite as well as the native warriors.the method was not at all complicated.if the thoats did not respond with sufficient celerity to the telepathic instructions of their riders they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears with the butt of a pistol and if they showed fight this treatment was continued until the brutes either were subdued or had unseated their riders.my experience with woola determined me to attempt the experiment of kindness in my treatment of my thoats.first i taught them that they could not unseat me and even rapped them sharply between the ears to impress upon them my authority and mastery.then by degrees i won their confidence in much the same manner as i had adopted countless times with my many mundane mounts.i was ever a good hand with animals and by inclination as well as because it brought more lasting and satisfactory results i was always kind and humane in my dealings with the lower orders.i could take a human life if necessary with far less compunction than that of a poor unreasoning irresponsible brute.in the course of a few days my thoats were the wonder of the entire community.they would follow me like dogs rubbing their great snouts against my body in awkward evidence of affection and respond to my every command with an alacrity and docility which caused the martian warriors to ascribe to me the possession of some earthly power unknown on mars.and so i explained as carefully as i could the entire method of training i had adopted with my beasts and later he had me repeat it before lorquas ptomel and the assembled warriors.that moment marked the beginning of a new existence for the poor thoats and before i left the community of lorquas ptomel i had the satisfaction of observing a regiment of as tractable and docile mounts as one might care to see.the effect on the precision and celerity of the military movements was so remarkable that lorquas ptomel presented me with a massive anklet of gold from his own leg as a sign of his appreciation of my service to the horde.on the seventh day following the battle with the air craft we again took up the march toward thark all probability of another attack being deemed remote by lorquas ptomel.during the days just preceding our departure i had seen but little of dejah thoris as i had been kept very busy by tars tarkas with my lessons in the art of martian warfare as well as in the training of my thoats.the few times i had visited her quarters she had been absent walking upon the streets with sola or investigating the buildings in the near vicinity of the plaza.i had warned them against venturing far from the plaza for fear of the great white apes whose ferocity i was only too well acquainted with.however since woola accompanied them on all their excursions and as sola was well armed there was comparatively little cause for fear.that she shared my sentiments in this respect i was positive for on my approach the look of pitiful hopelessness left her sweet countenance to be replaced by a smile of joyful welcome as she placed her little right hand upon my left shoulder in true red martian salute.dejah thoris laughed.i was very curious to know what i had said or done to cause her so much perturbation a moment before and so i continued to importune her to enlighten me.it was all greek to me but the more i begged her to explain the more positive became her denials of my request and so in very hopelessness i desisted.day had now given away to night and as we wandered along the great avenue lighted by the two moons of barsoom and with earth looking down upon us out of her luminous green eye it seemed that we were alone in the universe and i at least was content that it should be so.i loved dejah thoris.the touch of my arm upon her naked shoulder had spoken to me in words i would not mistake and i knew that i had loved her since the first moment that my eyes had met hers that first time in the plaza of the dead city of korad.my first impulse was to tell her of my love and then i thought of the helplessness of her position wherein i alone could lighten the burdens of her captivity and protect her in my poor way against the thousands of hereditary enemies she must face upon our arrival at thark.i could not chance causing her additional pain or sorrow by declaring a love which in all probability she did not return.should i be so indiscreet her position would be even more unbearable than now and the thought that she might feel that i was taking advantage of her helplessness to influence her decision was the final argument which sealed my lips.she was silent nor could i venture to repeat the question.yes i was a fool but i was in love and though i was suffering the greatest misery i had ever known i would not have had it otherwise for all the riches of barsoom.such is love and such are lovers wherever love is known.the morning of our departure for thark dawned clear and hot as do all martian mornings except for the six weeks when the snow melts at the poles.i sought out dejah thoris in the throng of departing chariots but she turned her shoulder to me and i could see the red blood mount to her cheek.with the foolish inconsistency of love i held my peace when i might have plead ignorance of the nature of my offense or at least the gravity of it and so have effected at worst a half conciliation.i sought out dejah thoris in the throng of departing chariots.my duty dictated that i must see that she was comfortable and so i glanced into her chariot and rearranged her silks and furs.in doing so i noted with horror that she was heavily chained by one ankle to the side of the vehicle.examining the manacles i saw that they fastened with a massive spring lock.i saw the strength of his reasoning at a flash and knew that it were futile to appeal from his decision but i asked that the key be taken from sarkoja and that she be directed to leave the prisoner alone in future.he looked at me long and earnestly before he spoke.sola seemed puzzled herself as though such strange actions on the part of two humans were quite beyond her as indeed they were poor child.we broke camp the next day at an early hour and marched with only a single halt until just before dark.two incidents broke the tediousness of the march.about noon we espied far to our right what was evidently an incubator and lorquas ptomel directed tars tarkas to investigate it.the latter took a dozen warriors including myself and we raced across the velvety carpeting of moss to the little enclosure.it was indeed an incubator but the eggs were very small in comparison with those i had seen hatching in ours at the time of my arrival on mars.tars tarkas dismounted and examined the enclosure minutely finally announcing that it belonged to the green men of warhoon and that the cement was scarcely dry where it had been walled up.i chose the same weapon he had drawn because i knew he prided himself upon his ability with it and i wished if i worsted him at all to do it with his own weapon.the fight that followed was a long one and delayed the resumption of the march for an hour.the entire community surrounded us leaving a clear space about one hundred feet in diameter for our battle.my enemy had recovered from his thrust and was making it extremely interesting for me so i reluctantly gave my attention to the work in hand but my mind was not upon the battle.when consciousness returned and as i soon learned i was down but a moment i sprang quickly to my feet searching for my sword and there i found it buried to the hilt in the green breast of zad who lay stone dead upon the ochre moss of the ancient sea bottom.as i regained my full senses i found his weapon piercing my left breast but only through the flesh and muscles which cover my ribs entering near the center of my chest and coming out below the shoulder.as i had lunged i had turned so that his sword merely passed beneath the muscles inflicting a painful but not dangerous wound.removing the blade from my body i also regained my own and turning my back upon his ugly carcass i moved sick sore and disgusted toward the chariots which bore my retinue and my belongings.a murmur of martian applause greeted me but i cared not for it.bleeding and weak i reached my women who accustomed to such happenings dressed my wounds applying the wonderful healing and remedial agents which make only the most instantaneous of death blows fatal.give a martian woman a chance and death must take a back seat.they soon had me patched up so that except for weakness from loss of blood and a little soreness around the wound i suffered no great distress from this thrust which under earthly treatment undoubtedly would have put me flat on my back for days.as i approached i found dejah thoris lying prone upon her silks and furs her lithe form wracked with sobs.she did not notice my presence nor did she hear me speaking with sola who was standing a short distance from the vehicle.sola mounted the chariot which was swinging into its place in line and i hastened to my waiting thoat and galloped to my station beside tars tarkas at the rear of the column.we sat silent for a few moments she wrapped in the gloomy thoughts of her terrible past and i in pity for the poor creatures whom the heartless senseless customs of their race had doomed to loveless lives of cruelty and of hate.presently she spoke.we made our entry into the great central plaza early in the afternoon.there were no enthusiastic friendly greetings for the returned expedition.those who chanced to be in sight spoke the names of warriors or women with whom they came in direct contact in the formal greeting of their kind but when it was discovered that they brought two captives a greater interest was aroused and dejah thoris and i were the centers of inquiring groups.she looked at me long and earnestly and i thought that she was softening toward me.she took a little step toward me her beautiful hands outstretched in a strange groping gesture.further conversation of a personal nature was prevented by the entrance of sola who was much agitated and wholly unlike her usual calm and possessed self.finally after studying the map carefully in the moonlight which now flooded the room i pointed out a waterway far to the north of us which also seemed to lead to helium.they came quite close to me rubbing their muzzles against my body and nosing for the bits of food it was always my practice to reward them with.opening the gates i ordered the two great beasts to pass out and then slipping quietly after them i closed the portals behind me.i reached the appointed meeting place safely but as dejah thoris and sola were not there i led my animals into the entrance hall of one of the large buildings.presuming that one of the other women of the same household may have come in to speak to sola and so delayed their departure i did not feel any undue apprehension until nearly an hour had passed without a sign of them and by the time another half hour had crawled away i was becoming filled with grave anxiety.then there broke upon the stillness of the night the sound of an approaching party which from the noise i knew could be no fugitives creeping stealthily toward liberty.soon the party was near me and from the black shadows of my entranceway i perceived a score of mounted warriors who in passing dropped a dozen words that fetched my heart clean into the top of my head.i did not rush headlong in but listened without to assure myself that it was dejah thoris and that it was safe to venture within.it was well indeed that i took this precaution for the conversation i heard was in the low gutturals of men and the words which finally came to me proved a most timely warning.the speaker was a chieftain and he was giving orders to four of his warriors.the brilliantly lighted apartments of the first floor told me where first to seek and advancing to the windows i peered within.i soon discovered that my approach was not to be the easy thing i had hoped for the rear rooms bordering the court were filled with warriors and women.i then glanced up at the stories above discovering that the third was apparently unlighted and so decided to make my entrance to the building from that point.it was the work of but a moment for me to reach the windows above and soon i had drawn myself within the sheltering shadows of the unlighted third floor.presently tal hajus made a sign that the chamber be cleared and that the prisoners be left alone before him.slowly the chieftains the warriors and the women melted away into the shadows of the surrounding chambers and dejah thoris and sola stood alone before the jeddak of the tharks.tal hajus arose and i half fearing half anticipating his intentions hurried to the winding runway which led to the floors below.no one was near to intercept me and i reached the main floor of the chamber unobserved taking my station in the shadow of the same column that tars tarkas had but just deserted.as i reached the floor tal hajus was speaking.in the same deathly silence i grasped dejah thoris by the hand and motioning sola to follow we sped noiselessly from the chamber and to the floor above.unseen we reached a rear window and with the straps and leather of my trappings i lowered first sola and then dejah thoris to the ground below.dropping lightly after them i drew them rapidly around the court in the shadows of the buildings and thus we returned over the same course i had so recently followed from the distant boundary of the city.we finally came upon my thoats in the courtyard where i had left them and placing the trappings upon them we hastened through the building to the avenue beyond.mounting sola upon one beast and dejah thoris behind me upon the other we rode from the city of thark through the hills to the south.instead of circling back around the city to the northwest and toward the nearest waterway which lay so short a distance from us we turned to the northeast and struck out upon the mossy waste across which for two hundred dangerous and weary miles lay another main artery leading to helium.no word was spoken until we had left the city far behind but i could hear the quiet sobbing of dejah thoris as she clung to me with her dear head resting against my shoulder.our earlier plans had been so sadly upset that we now found ourselves without food or drink and i alone was armed.we therefore urged our beasts to a speed that must tell on them sorely before we could hope to sight the ending of the first stage of our journey.evidently we had circled but which way it was difficult to say nor did it seem possible with the sun to guide us by day and the moons and stars by night.at any rate no waterway was in sight and the entire party was almost ready to drop from hunger thirst and fatigue.far ahead of us and a trifle to the right we could distinguish the outlines of low mountains.these we decided to attempt to reach in the hope that from some ridge we might discern the missing waterway.night fell upon us before we reached our goal and almost fainting from weariness and weakness we lay down and slept.they doubtless were thark warriors who had been sent out to capture us and we breathed a great sigh of relief that they were traveling in the opposite direction.quickly lifting dejah thoris from the thoat i commanded the animal to lie down and we three did the same presenting as small an object as possible for fear of attracting the attention of the warriors toward us.springing to my feet i urged the thoat to rise and directed sola to take dejah thoris with her upon him and make a mighty effort to reach the hills before the green warriors were upon us.i knew that in the ravines and gullies they might find a temporary hiding place and even though they died there of hunger and thirst it would be better so than that they fell into the hands of the tharks.forcing my two revolvers upon them as a slight means of protection and as a last resort as an escape for themselves from the horrid death which recapture would surely mean i lifted dejah thoris in my arms and placed her upon the thoat behind sola who had already mounted at my command.if ever martians had an exhibition of jumping it was granted those astonished warriors on that day long years ago but while it led them away from dejah thoris it did not distract their attention from endeavoring to capture me.it must have been several hours before i regained consciousness and i well remember the feeling of surprise which swept over me as i realized that i was not dead.i was lying among a pile of sleeping silks and furs in the corner of a small room in which were several green warriors and bending over me was an ancient and ugly female.and now as my eyes fell upon him i saw that he was no thark for his ornaments and metal were not of that horde.he was a huge fellow terribly scarred about the face and chest and with one broken tusk and a missing ear.strapped on either breast were human skulls and depending from these a number of dried human hands.his reference to the great games of which i had heard so much while among the tharks convinced me that i had but jumped from purgatory into gehenna.after a few more words with the female during which she assured him that i was now fully fit to travel the jed ordered that we mount and ride after the main column.i was strapped securely to as wild and unmanageable a thoat as i had ever seen and with a mounted warrior on either side to prevent the beast from bolting we rode forth at a furious pace in pursuit of the column.my wounds gave me but little pain so wonderfully and rapidly had the applications and injections of the female exercised their therapeutic powers and so deftly had she bound and plastered the injuries.just before dark we reached the main body of troops shortly after they had made camp for the night.i was immediately taken before the leader who proved to be the jeddak of the hordes of warhoon.like the jed who had brought me he was frightfully scarred and also decorated with the breastplate of human skulls and dried dead hands which seemed to mark all the greater warriors among the warhoons as well as to indicate their awful ferocity which greatly transcends even that of the tharks.the jeddak bar comas who was comparatively young was the object of the fierce and jealous hatred of his old lieutenant dak kova the jed who had captured me and i could not but note the almost studied efforts which the latter made to affront his superior.he entirely omitted the usual formal salutation as we entered the presence of the jeddak and as he pushed me roughly before the ruler he exclaimed in a loud and menacing voice.bar comas eyed the defiant and insubordinate chieftain for an instant his expression one of haughty fearless contempt and hate and then without drawing a weapon and without uttering a word he hurled himself at the throat of his defamer.the injuries to dak kova had delayed the march so greatly that it was decided to give up the expedition which was a raid upon a small thark community in retaliation for the destruction of the incubator until after the great games and the entire body of warriors ten thousand in number turned back toward warhoon.my introduction to these cruel and bloodthirsty people was but an index to the scenes i witnessed almost daily while with them.they are a smaller horde than the tharks but much more ferocious.not a day passed but that some members of the various warhoon communities met in deadly combat.i have seen as high as eight mortal duels within a single day.finally all the hatred and maniacal loathing for these awful creatures who had placed me in this horrible place was centered by my tottering reason upon this single emissary who represented to me the entire horde of warhoons.i had noticed that he always advanced with his dim torch to where he could place the food within my reach and as he stooped to place it upon the floor his head was about on a level with my breast.so with the cunning of a madman i backed into the far corner of my cell when next i heard him approaching and gathering a little slack of the great chain which held me in my hand i waited his coming crouching like some beast of prey.as he stooped to place my food upon the ground i swung the chain above my head and crashed the links with all my strength upon his skull.without a sound he slipped to the floor stone dead.laughing and chattering like the idiot i was fast becoming i fell upon his prostrate form my fingers feeling for his dead throat.presently they came in contact with a small chain at the end of which dangled a number of keys.the touch of my fingers on these keys brought back my reason with the suddenness of thought.no longer was i a jibbering idiot but a sane reasoning man with the means of escape within my very hands.for two days no food was brought me but then a new messenger appeared and my incarceration went on as before but not again did i allow my reason to be submerged by the horror of my position.shortly after this episode another prisoner was brought in and chained near me.by the dim torch light i saw that he was a red martian and i could scarcely await the departure of his guards to address him.as their retreating footsteps died away in the distance i called out softly the martian word of greeting kaor.thirty days after the capture of dejah thoris or about the time of our coming to thark his vessel had reached helium with about ten survivors of the original crew of seven hundred officers and men.immediately seven great fleets each of one hundred mighty war ships had been dispatched to search for dejah thoris and from these vessels two thousand smaller craft had been kept out continuously in futile search for the missing princess.two green martian communities had been wiped off the face of barsoom by the avenging fleets but no trace of dejah thoris had been found.they had been searching among the northern hordes and only within the past few days had they extended their quest to the south.during the period of our incarceration kantos kan and i became well acquainted and formed a warm personal friendship.a few days only elapsed however before we were dragged forth from our dungeon for the great games.we were conducted early one morning to an enormous amphitheater which instead of having been built upon the surface of the ground was excavated below the surface.it had partially filled with debris so that how large it had originally been was difficult to say.in its present condition it held the entire twenty thousand warhoons of the assembled hordes.the arena was immense but extremely uneven and unkempt.around it the warhoons had piled building stone from some of the ruined edifices of the ancient city to prevent the animals and the captives from escaping into the audience and at each end had been constructed cages to hold them until their turns came to meet some horrible death upon the arena.kantos kan and i were confined together in one of the cages.in the others were wild calots thoats mad zitidars green warriors and women of other hordes and many strange and ferocious wild beasts of barsoom which i had never before seen.the din of their roaring growling and squealing was deafening and the formidable appearance of any one of them was enough to make the stoutest heart feel grave forebodings.shortly after we had been caged the amphitheater began to fill and within an hour every available part of the seating space was occupied.dak kova with his jeds and chieftains sat at the center of one side of the arena upon a large raised platform.at a signal from dak kova the doors of two cages were thrown open and a dozen green martian females were driven to the center of the arena.each was given a dagger and then at the far end a pack of twelve calots or wild dogs were loosed upon them.as the brutes growling and foaming rushed upon the almost defenseless women i turned my head that i might not see the horrid sight.the yells and laughter of the green horde bore witness to the excellent quality of the sport and when i turned back to the arena as kantos kan told me it was over i saw three victorious calots snarling and growling over the bodies of their prey.the women had given a good account of themselves.next a mad zitidar was loosed among the remaining dogs and so it went throughout the long hot horrible day.finally there were but three of us left a great green warrior of some far northern horde kantos kan and myself.the other two were to battle and then i to fight the conqueror for the liberty which was accorded the final winner.kantos kan and i were now pitted against each other but as we approached to the encounter i whispered to him to prolong the battle until nearly dark in the hope that we might find some means of escape.the horde evidently guessed that we had no hearts to fight each other and so they howled in rage as neither of us placed a fatal thrust.just as i saw the sudden coming of dark i whispered to kantos kan to thrust his sword between my left arm and my body.as he did so i staggered back clasping the sword tightly with my arm and thus fell to the ground with his weapon apparently protruding from my chest.kantos kan perceived my coup and stepping quickly to my side he placed his foot upon my neck and withdrawing his sword from my body gave me the final death blow through the neck which is supposed to sever the jugular vein but in this instance the cold blade slipped harmlessly into the sand of the arena.in the darkness which had now fallen none could tell but that he had really finished me.i whispered to him to go and claim his freedom and then look for me in the hills east of the city and so he left me.when the amphitheater had cleared i crept stealthily to the top and as the great excavation lay far from the plaza and in an untenanted portion of the great dead city i had little trouble in reaching the hills beyond.for two days i waited there for kantos kan but as he did not come i started off on foot in a northwesterly direction toward a point where he had told me lay the nearest waterway.my only food consisted of vegetable milk from the plants which gave so bounteously of this priceless fluid.without sound we lay there the beast exerting every effort to reach me with those awful fangs and i straining to maintain my grip and choke the life from it as i kept it from my throat.slowly my arms gave to the unequal struggle and inch by inch the burning eyes and gleaming tusks of my antagonist crept toward me until as the hairy face touched mine again i realized that all was over.and then a living mass of destruction sprang from the surrounding darkness full upon the creature that held me pinioned to the ground.the two rolled growling upon the moss tearing and rending one another in a frightful manner but it was soon over and my preserver stood with lowered head above the throat of the dead thing which would have killed me.the nearer moon hurtling suddenly above the horizon and lighting up the barsoomian scene showed me that my preserver was woola but from whence he had come or how found me i was at a loss to know.that i was glad of his companionship it is needless to say but my pleasure at seeing him was tempered by anxiety as to the reason of his leaving dejah thoris.only her death i felt sure could account for his absence from her so faithful i knew him to be to my commands.by the light of the now brilliant moons i saw that he was but a shadow of his former self and as he turned from my caress and commenced greedily to devour the dead carcass at my feet i realized that the poor fellow was more than half starved.i myself was in but little better plight but i could not bring myself to eat the uncooked flesh and i had no means of making a fire.when woola had finished his meal i again took up my weary and seemingly endless wandering in quest of the elusive waterway.at daybreak of the fifteenth day of my search i was overjoyed to see the high trees that denoted the object of my search.about noon i dragged myself wearily to the portals of a huge building which covered perhaps four square miles and towered two hundred feet in the air.it showed no aperture in the mighty walls other than the tiny door at which i sank exhausted nor was there any sign of life about it.i could find no bell or other method of making my presence known to the inmates of the place unless a small round role in the wall near the door was for that purpose.it was of about the bigness of a lead pencil and thinking that it might be in the nature of a speaking tube i put my mouth to it and was about to call into it when a voice issued from it asking me whom i might be where from and the nature of my errand.i explained that i had escaped from the warhoons and was dying of starvation and exhaustion.presently the door commenced to recede before me until it had sunk into the wall fifty feet then it stopped and slid easily to the left exposing a short narrow corridor of concrete at the further end of which was another door similar in every respect to the one i had just passed.no one was in sight yet immediately we passed the first door it slid gently into place behind us and receded rapidly to its original position in the front wall of the building.as the door had slipped aside i had noted its great thickness fully twenty feet and as it reached its place once more after closing behind us great cylinders of steel had dropped from the ceiling behind it and fitted their lower ends into apertures countersunk in the floor.the old man sat and talked with me for hours and the strangest part of our intercourse was that i could read his every thought while he could not fathom an iota from my mind unless i spoke.the old man sat and talked with me for hours.i did not apprise him of my ability to sense his mental operations and thus i learned a great deal which proved of immense value to me later and which i would never have known had he suspected my strange power for the martians have such perfect control of their mental machinery that they are able to direct their thoughts with absolute precision.there is always sufficient reserve of the ninth ray stored in the great building to maintain the present martian atmosphere for a thousand years and the only fear as my new friend told me was that some accident might befall the pumping apparatus.every red martian is taught during earliest childhood the principles of the manufacture of atmosphere but only two at one time ever hold the secret of ingress to the great building which built as it is with walls a hundred and fifty feet thick is absolutely unassailable even the roof being guarded from assault by air craft by a glass covering five feet thick.the only fear they entertain of attack is from the green martians or some demented red man as all barsoomians realize that the very existence of every form of life of mars is dependent upon the uninterrupted working of this plant.from then on his manner toward me changed as though he feared that he had been surprised into divulging his great secret and i read suspicion and fear in his looks and thoughts though his words were still fair.before i retired for the night he promised to give me a letter to a nearby agricultural officer who would help me on my way to zodanga which he said was the nearest martian city.as he closed the door of my chamber behind him his thoughts were cut off from me as was the sight of him which seemed strange to me in my little knowledge of thought transference.creeping stealthily through corridor after corridor and down winding runways which turned hither and thither i finally reached the great hall in which i had broken my long fast that morning.nowhere had i seen my host nor did i know where he kept himself by night.i was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a slight noise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess in the corridor.dragging woola after me i crouched low in the darkness.presently the old man passed close by me and as he entered the dimly lighted chamber which i had been about to pass through i saw that he held a long thin dagger in his hand and that he was sharpening it upon a stone.in his mind was the decision to inspect the radium pumps which would take about thirty minutes and then return to my bed chamber and finish me.concentrating my mind upon the massive lock i hurled the nine thought waves against it.in breathless expectancy i waited when finally the great door moved softly toward me and slid quietly to one side.one after the other the remaining mighty portals opened at my command and woola and i stepped forth into the darkness free but little better off than we had been before other than that we had full stomachs.hastening away from the shadows of the formidable pile i made for the first crossroad intending to strike the central turnpike as quickly as possible.this i reached about morning and entering the first enclosure i came to i searched for some evidences of a habitation.there were low rambling buildings of concrete barred with heavy impassable doors and no amount of hammering and hallooing brought any response.weary and exhausted from sleeplessness i threw myself upon the ground commanding woola to stand guard.some time later i was awakened by his frightful growlings and opened my eyes to see three red martians standing a short distance from us and covering me with their rifles.they lowered their rifles and advanced pleasantly toward me placing their right hands upon my left shoulder after the manner of their custom of salute and asking me many questions about myself and my wanderings.they then took me to the house of one of them which was only a short distance away.they were the personification of cordiality and hospitality and i spent several days with them resting and recuperating from my long and arduous experiences.when i was ready to depart they furnished me with a small domestic bull thoat such as is used for saddle purposes by all red martians.the animal is about the size of a horse and quite gentle but in color and shape an exact replica of his huge and fierce cousin of the wilds.they filled a little sack at my side with zodangan money.the medium of exchange upon mars is not dissimilar from our own except that the coins are oval.paper money is issued by individuals as they require it and redeemed twice yearly.if a man issues more than he can redeem the government pays his creditors in full and the debtor works out the amount upon the farms or in mines which are all owned by the government.this suits everybody except the debtor as it has been a difficult thing to obtain sufficient voluntary labor to work the great isolated farm lands of mars stretching as they do like narrow ribbons from pole to pole through wild stretches peopled by wild animals and wilder men.when i mentioned my inability to repay them for their kindness to me they assured me that i would have ample opportunity if i lived long upon barsoom and bidding me farewell they watched me until i was out of sight upon the broad white turnpike.as i proceeded on my journey toward zodanga many strange and interesting sights arrested my attention and at the several farm houses where i stopped i learned a number of new and instructive things concerning the methods and manners of barsoom.the water which supplies the farms of mars is collected in immense underground reservoirs at either pole from the melting ice caps and pumped through long conduits to the various populated centers.along either side of these conduits and extending their entire length lie the cultivated districts.these are divided into tracts of about the same size each tract being under the supervision of one or more government officers.instead of flooding the surface of the fields and thus wasting immense quantities of water by evaporation the precious liquid is carried underground through a vast network of small pipes directly to the roots of the vegetation.the crops upon mars are always uniform for there are no droughts no rains no high winds and no insects or destroying birds.at a second stop i met some highly cultivated people of the noble class and while in conversation we chanced to speak of helium.one of the older men had been there on a diplomatic mission several years before and spoke with regret of the conditions which seemed destined ever to keep these two countries at war.ten days after leaving the three ptor brothers i arrived at zodanga.from the moment that i had come in contact with the red inhabitants of mars i had noticed that woola drew a great amount of unwelcome attention to me since the huge brute belonged to a species which is never domesticated by the red men.were one to stroll down broadway with a numidian lion at his heels the effect would be somewhat similar to that which i should have produced had i entered zodanga with woola.the ptor brothers had given me explicit directions for reaching the point of the city where i could find living accommodations and be near the offices of the government agents to whom they had given me letters.my way led to the central square or plaza which is a characteristic of all martian cities.the plaza of zodanga covers a square mile and is bounded by the palaces of the jeddak the jeds and other members of the royalty and nobility of zodanga as well as by the principal public buildings cafes and shops.the plaza was now commencing to fill with people going and coming upon the daily activities of their duties.the shops were opening and the cafes filling with early morning patrons.kantos kan led me to one of these gorgeous eating places where we were served entirely by mechanical apparatus.no hand touched the food from the time it entered the building in its raw state until it emerged hot and delicious upon the tables before the guests in response to the touching of tiny buttons to indicate their desires.it is this ray which has enabled them to so perfect aviation that battle ships far outweighing anything known upon earth sail as gracefully and lightly through the thin air of barsoom as a toy balloon in the heavy atmosphere of earth.during the early years of the discovery of this ray many strange accidents occurred before the martians learned to measure and control the wonderful power they had found.in one instance some nine hundred years before the first great battle ship to be built with eighth ray reservoirs was stored with too great a quantity of the rays and she had sailed up from helium with five hundred officers and men never to return.the fourth day after my arrival at zodanga i made my first flight and as a result of it i won a promotion which included quarters in the palace of than kosis.as i rose above the city i circled several times as i had seen kantos kan do and then throwing my engine into top speed i raced at terrific velocity toward the south following one of the great waterways which enter zodanga from that direction.i had traversed perhaps two hundred miles in a little less than an hour when i descried far below me a party of three green warriors racing madly toward a small figure on foot which seemed to be trying to reach the confines of one of the walled fields.dropping my machine rapidly toward them and circling to the rear of the warriors i soon saw that the object of their pursuit was a red martian wearing the metal of the scout squadron to which i was attached.a short distance away lay his tiny flier surrounded by the tools with which he had evidently been occupied in repairing some damage when surprised by the green warriors.we wasted no time in talk as we knew that the warriors would surely return as soon as they had gained control of their mounts.hastening to his damaged machine we were bending every effort to finish the needed repairs and had almost completed them when we saw the two green monsters returning at top speed from opposite sides of us.when they had approached within a hundred yards their thoats again became unmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the air craft which had frightened them.i advanced to meet the larger telling the zodangan to do the best he could with the other.finishing my man with almost no effort as had now from much practice become habitual with me i hastened to return to my new acquaintance whom i found indeed in desperate straits.a cursory examination of the latter revealed no mortal injuries and after a brief rest he asserted that he felt fit to attempt the return voyage.he would have to pilot his own craft however as these frail vessels are not intended to convey but a single person.quickly completing the repairs we rose together into the still cloudless martian sky and at great speed and without further mishap returned to zodanga.one of the staff called the attention of than kosis to the presence of my companion above them and the ruler motioned for him to descend.as they waited for the troops to move into position facing the jeddak the two talked earnestly together the jeddak and his staff occasionally glancing up at me.i could not hear their conversation and presently it ceased and all dismounted as the last body of troops had wheeled into position before their emperor.a member of the staff advanced toward the troops and calling the name of a soldier commanded him to advance.the officer then recited the nature of the heroic act which had won the approval of the jeddak and the latter advanced and placed a metal ornament upon the left arm of the lucky man.never in my life had i been so surprised but the habit of military discipline is strong within me and i dropped my little machine lightly to the ground and advanced on foot as i had seen the others do.as i halted before the officer he addressed me in a voice audible to the entire assemblage of troops and spectators.he therefore escorted me immediately to the apartment in which than kosis then was.the ruler was engaged in conversation with his son sab than and several courtiers of his household and did not perceive my entrance.the tapestries were of a strange weaving which gave the appearance of heavy solidity from one side but from my hiding place i could perceive all that took place within the room as readily as though there had been no curtain intervening.scarcely had i gained my post than the tapestry at the opposite end of the chamber separated and four soldiers of the guard entered surrounding a female figure.as they approached than kosis the soldiers fell to either side and there standing before the jeddak and not ten feet from me her beautiful face radiant with smiles was dejah thoris.sab than prince of zodanga advanced to meet her and hand in hand they approached close to the jeddak.than kosis looked up in surprise and rising saluted her.dejah thoris after a few words turned and left the apartment still followed by her guards.although i had heard it with my own ears i could not believe it.i must search out her apartments and force her to repeat the cruel truth to me alone before i would be convinced and so i deserted my post and hastened through the passage behind the tapestries toward the door by which she had left the chamber.slipping quietly through this opening i discovered a maze of winding corridors branching and turning in every direction.running rapidly down first one and then another of them i soon became hopelessly lost and was standing panting against a side wall when i heard voices near me.apparently they were coming from the opposite side of the partition against which i leaned and presently i made out the tones of dejah thoris.i could not hear the words but i knew that i could not possibly be mistaken in the voice.moving on a few steps i discovered another passageway at the end of which lay a door.walking boldly forward i pushed into the room only to find myself in a small antechamber in which were the four guards who had accompanied her.one of them instantly arose and accosted me asking the nature of my business.i did not know what he meant but replied that i was a member of the guard and without waiting for a reply from him i strode toward the opposite door of the antechamber behind which i could hear dejah thoris conversing.for reply he whipped out his own sword calling to the others to join him and thus the four stood with drawn weapons barring my further progress.the noise had brought dejah thoris to the door of her apartment and there she stood throughout the conflict with sola at her back peering over her shoulder.her face was set and emotionless and i knew that she did not recognize me nor did sola.finally a lucky cut brought down a second guardsman and then with only two opposing me i changed my tactics and rushed them down after the fashion of my fighting that had won me many a victory.the third fell within ten seconds after the second and the last lay dead upon the bloody floor a few moments later.they were brave men and noble fighters and it grieved me that i had been forced to kill them but i would have willingly depopulated all barsoom could i have reached the side of my dejah thoris in no other way.sheathing my bloody blade i advanced toward my martian princess who still stood mutely gazing at me without sign of recognition.as i came close to her she swayed toward me with outstretched hands but as i reached to take her in my arms she drew back with a shudder and a little moan of misery.disheartened and dejected i withdrew from the room but i was not entirely discouraged nor would i admit that dejah thoris was lost to me until the ceremony had actually been performed.i knew that my only hope lay in escape from the city of zodanga for the matter of the four dead guardsmen would have to be explained and as i could never reach my original post without a guide suspicion would surely rest on me so soon as i was discovered wandering aimlessly through the palace.presently i came upon a spiral runway leading to a lower floor and this i followed downward for several stories until i reached the doorway of a large apartment in which were a number of guardsmen.the walls of this room were hung with transparent tapestries behind which i secreted myself without being apprehended.the conversation of the guardsmen was general and awakened no interest in me until an officer entered the room and ordered four of the men to relieve the detail who were guarding the princess of helium.now i knew my troubles would commence in earnest and indeed they were upon me all too soon for it seemed that the squad had scarcely left the guardroom before one of their number burst in again breathlessly crying that they had found their four comrades butchered in the antechamber.this was my opportunity and slim as it appeared i grasped it for as a number of soldiers came hurrying past my hiding place i fell in behind them and followed through the mazes of the palace until in passing through a great hall i saw the blessed light of day coming in through a series of larger windows.here i left my guides and slipping to the nearest window sought for an avenue of escape.the windows opened upon a great balcony which overlooked one of the broad avenues of zodanga.the ground was about thirty feet below and at a like distance from the building was a wall fully twenty feet high constructed of polished glass about a foot in thickness.to a red martian escape by this path would have appeared impossible but to me with my earthly strength and agility it seemed already accomplished.my only fear was in being detected before darkness fell for i could not make the leap in broad daylight while the court below and the avenue beyond were crowded with zodangans.he paused to let the full weight of this announcement impress his hearers and that his statement was scarcely credited was evidenced by the impatient exclamation of incredulity which escaped the lips of than kosis.another messenger now entered with word that i was still within the palace walls.they left the hall and as darkness had fallen without i slipped lightly from my hiding place and hastened to the balcony.few were in sight and choosing a moment when none seemed near i sprang quickly to the top of the glass wall and from there to the avenue beyond the palace grounds.without effort at concealment i hastened to the vicinity of our quarters where i felt sure i should find kantos kan.as i neared the building i became more careful as i judged and rightly that the place would be guarded.several men in civilian metal loitered near the front entrance and in the rear were others.my only means of reaching unseen the upper story where our apartments were situated was through an adjoining building and after considerable maneuvering i managed to attain the roof of a shop several doors away.leaping from roof to roof i soon reached an open window in the building where i hoped to find the heliumite and in another moment i stood in the room before him.he was alone and showed no surprise at my coming saying he had expected me much earlier as my tour of duty must have ended some time since.i saw that he knew nothing of the events of the day at the palace and when i had enlightened him he was all excitement.the news that dejah thoris had promised her hand to sab than filled him with dismay.kantos kan eyed me narrowly before he spoke.he bent his head in thought a moment then raised it with an air of confidence.it was a long climb up the face of the building and one fraught with much danger but there was no other way and so i essayed the task.the fact that barsoomian architecture is extremely ornate made the feat much simpler than i had anticipated since i found ornamental ledges and projections which fairly formed a perfect ladder for me all the way to the eaves of the building.here i met my first real obstacle.the eaves projected nearly twenty feet from the wall to which i clung and though i encircled the great building i could find no opening through them.clinging to the wall with my feet and one hand i unloosened one of the long leather straps of my trappings at the end of which dangled a great hook by which air sailors are hung to the sides and bottoms of their craft for various purposes of repair and by means of which landing parties are lowered to the ground from the battleships.clambering quickly aloft i grasped the edge of the eaves and drew myself to the surface of the roof above.as i gained my feet i was confronted by the sentry on duty into the muzzle of whose revolver i found myself looking.the fellow acting on impulse of curiosity stepped to my side and to his undoing for as he leaned to peer over the eaves i grasped him by his throat and his pistol arm and threw him heavily to the roof.the weapon dropped from his grasp and my fingers choked off his attempted cry for assistance.i gagged and bound him and then hung him over the edge of the roof as i myself had hung a few moments before.i knew it would be morning before he would be discovered and i needed all the time that i could gain.i lost no time in explanation but plunged immediately into a discussion of our plans for the immediate future.it was decided that i was to try to make helium while kantos kan was to enter the palace and dispatch sab than.if successful he was then to follow me.he set my compass for me a clever little device which will remain steadfastly fixed upon any given point on the surface of barsoom and bidding each other farewell we rose together and sped in the direction of the palace which lay in the route which i must take to reach helium.kantos kan had shown me a trick of gearing which is known only to the navy of helium that greatly increased the speed of our machines so that i felt sure i could distance my pursuers if i could dodge their projectiles for a few moments.how far i fell before i regained control of the plane i do not know but i must have been very close to the ground when i started to rise again as i plainly heard the squealing of animals below me.rising again i scanned the heavens for my pursuers and finally making out their lights far behind me saw that they were landing evidently in search of me.not until their lights were no longer discernible did i venture to flash my little lamp upon my compass and then i found to my consternation that a fragment of the projectile had utterly destroyed my only guide as well as my speedometer.it was true i could follow the stars in the general direction of helium but without knowing the exact location of the city or the speed at which i was traveling my chances for finding it were slim.about noon i passed low over a great dead city of ancient mars and as i skimmed out across the plain beyond i came full upon several thousand green warriors engaged in a terrific battle.scarcely had i seen them than a volley of shots was directed at me and with the almost unfailing accuracy of their aim my little craft was instantly a ruined wreck sinking erratically to the ground.i fell beside a huge monster who was engaged with three antagonists and as i glanced at his fierce face filled with the light of battle i recognized tars tarkas the thark.he did not see me as i was a trifle behind him and just then the three warriors opposing him and whom i recognized as warhoons charged simultaneously.the mighty fellow made quick work of one of them but in stepping back for another thrust he fell over a dead body behind him and was down and at the mercy of his foes in an instant.quick as lightning they were upon him and tars tarkas would have been gathered to his fathers in short order had i not sprung before his prostrate form and engaged his adversaries.i had accounted for one of them when the mighty thark regained his feet and quickly settled the other.he said no more nor was there opportunity for the warhoons were closing in about us and together we fought shoulder to shoulder during all that long hot afternoon until the tide of battle turned and the remnant of the fierce warhoon horde fell back upon their thoats and fled into the gathering darkness.ten thousand men had been engaged in that titanic struggle and upon the field of battle lay three thousand dead.neither side asked or gave quarter nor did they attempt to take prisoners.he objected strenuously saying that tal hajus often flew into wild fits of passion at the mere thought of the blow i had dealt him and that if ever he laid his hands upon me i would be subjected to the most horrible tortures.while we were eating i repeated to tars tarkas the story which sola had told me that night upon the sea bottom during the march to thark.he said but little but the great muscles of his face worked in passion and in agony at recollection of the horrors which had been heaped upon the only thing he had ever loved in all his cold cruel terrible existence.he no longer demurred when i suggested that we go before tal hajus only saying that he would like to speak to sarkoja first.at his request i accompanied him to her quarters and the look of venomous hatred she cast upon me was almost adequate recompense for any future misfortunes this accidental return to thark might bring me.the next morning sarkoja was gone nor was she ever seen after.after i ceased there was tense silence as all eyes were riveted upon tal hajus.he did not speak or move but the blotchy green of his countenance turned livid and the froth froze upon his lips.there were twenty chieftains about the rostrum and twenty swords flashed high in assent.the combat was soon over and with his foot upon the neck of the dead monster tars tarkas became jeddak among the tharks.seeing the favorable disposition of the warriors toward tars tarkas as well as toward me i grasped the opportunity to enlist them in my cause against zodanga.i told tars tarkas the story of my adventures and in a few words had explained to him the thought i had in mind.it was a chance to fight an opportunity to loot and they rose to the bait as a speckled trout to a fly.for tharks they were wildly enthusiastic and before another half hour had passed twenty mounted messengers were speeding across dead sea bottoms to call the hordes together for the expedition.in three days we were on the march toward zodanga one hundred thousand strong as tars tarkas had been able to enlist the services of three smaller hordes on the promise of the great loot of zodanga.at the head of the column i rode beside the great thark while at the heels of my mount trotted my beloved woola.we traveled entirely by night timing our marches so that we camped during the day at deserted cities where even to the beasts we were all kept indoors during the daylight hours.on the march tars tarkas through his remarkable ability and statesmanship enlisted fifty thousand more warriors from various hordes so that ten days after we set out we halted at midnight outside the great walled city of zodanga one hundred and fifty thousand strong.the fighting strength and efficiency of this horde of ferocious green monsters was equivalent to ten times their number of red men.never in the history of barsoom tars tarkas told me had such a force of green warriors marched to battle together.it was a monstrous task to keep even a semblance of harmony among them and it was a marvel to me that he got them to the city without a mighty battle among themselves.but as we neared zodanga their personal quarrels were submerged by their greater hatred for the red men and especially for the zodangans who had for years waged a ruthless campaign of extermination against the green men directing special attention toward despoiling their incubators.now that we were before zodanga the task of obtaining entry to the city devolved upon me and directing tars tarkas to hold his forces in two divisions out of earshot of the city with each division opposite a large gateway i took twenty dismounted warriors and approached one of the small gates that pierced the walls at short intervals.these gates have no regular guard but are covered by sentries who patrol the avenue that encircles the city just within the walls as our metropolitan police patrol their beats.placing three of them with their faces to the wall and arms locked i commanded two more to mount to their shoulders and a sixth i ordered to climb upon the shoulders of the upper two.the head of the topmost warrior towered over forty feet from the ground.in this way with ten warriors i built a series of three steps from the ground to the shoulders of the topmost man.then starting from a short distance behind them i ran swiftly up from one tier to the next and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest i clutched the top of the great wall and quietly drew myself to its broad expanse.after me i dragged six lengths of leather from an equal number of my warriors.these lengths we had previously fastened together and passing one end to the topmost warrior i lowered the other end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the avenue below.no one was in sight so lowering myself to the end of my leather strap i dropped the remaining thirty feet to the pavement below.i had learned from kantos kan the secret of opening these gates and in another moment my twenty great fighting men stood within the doomed city of zodanga.i found to my delight that i had entered at the lower boundary of the enormous palace grounds.the building itself showed in the distance a blaze of glorious light and on the instant i determined to lead a detachment of warriors directly within the palace itself while the balance of the great horde was attacking the barracks of the soldiery.dispatching one of my men to tars tarkas for a detail of fifty tharks with word of my intentions i ordered ten warriors to capture and open one of the great gates while with the nine remaining i took the other.we were to do our work quietly no shots were to be fired and no general advance made until i had reached the palace with my fifty tharks.our plans worked to perfection.the two sentries we met were dispatched to their fathers upon the banks of the lost sea of korus and the guards at both gates followed them in silence.as the great gate where i stood swung open my fifty tharks headed by tars tarkas himself rode in upon their mighty thoats.i led them to the palace walls which i negotiated easily without assistance.once inside however the gate gave me considerable trouble but i finally was rewarded by seeing it swing upon its huge hinges and soon my fierce escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of zodanga.as we approached the palace i could see through the great windows of the first floor into the brilliantly illuminated audience chamber of than kosis.the immense hall was crowded with nobles and their women as though some important function was in progress.there was not a guard in sight without the palace due i presume to the fact that the city and palace walls were considered impregnable and so i came close and peered within.at one end of the chamber upon massive golden thrones encrusted with diamonds sat than kosis and his consort surrounded by officers and dignitaries of state.before them stretched a broad aisle lined on either side with soldiery and as i looked there entered this aisle at the far end of the hall the head of a procession which advanced to the foot of the throne.at the foot of the throne these two parties separated and halted facing each other at opposite sides of the aisle.then came more dignitaries and the officers of the palace and of the army and finally two figures entirely muffled in scarlet silk so that not a feature of either was discernible.these two stopped at the foot of the throne facing than kosis.when the balance of the procession had entered and assumed their stations than kosis addressed the couple standing before him.i could not hear his words but presently two officers advanced and removed the scarlet robe from one of the figures and i saw that kantos kan had failed in his mission for it was sab than prince of zodanga who stood revealed before me.all eyes turned in the direction i had indicated and there forging through the portals of the entranceway rode tars tarkas and his fifty warriors on their great thoats.a cry of alarm and amazement broke from the assemblage but no word of fear and in a moment the soldiers and nobles of zodanga were hurling themselves upon the advancing tharks.calling to dejah thoris to get behind me i worked my way toward the little doorway back of the throne but the officers realized my intentions and three of them sprang in behind me and blocked my chances for gaining a position where i could have defended dejah thoris against any army of swordsmen.the tharks were having their hands full in the center of the room and i began to realize that nothing short of a miracle could save dejah thoris and myself when i saw tars tarkas surging through the crowd of pygmies that swarmed about him.with one swing of his mighty longsword he laid a dozen corpses at his feet and so he hewed a pathway before him until in another moment he stood upon the platform beside me dealing death and destruction right and left.sab than lay dead beside his father and the corpses of the flower of zodangan nobility and chivalry covered the floor of the bloody shambles.my first thought when the battle was over was for kantos kan and leaving dejah thoris in charge of tars tarkas i took a dozen warriors and hastened to the dungeons beneath the palace.the jailers had all left to join the fighters in the throne room so we searched the labyrinthine prison without opposition.he was overjoyed at seeing me and to know the meaning of the fight faint echoes of which had reached his prison cell.he told me that the air patrol had captured him before he reached the high tower of the palace so that he had not even seen sab than.we discovered that it would be futile to attempt to cut away the bars and chains which held him prisoner so at his suggestion i returned to search the bodies on the floor above for keys to open the padlocks of his cell and of his chains.fortunately among the first i examined i found his jailer and soon we had kantos kan with us in the throne room.she had sunk into one of the golden thrones and as i turned to her she greeted me with a wan smile.sometime later tars tarkas and kantos kan returned to report that zodanga had been completely reduced.her forces were entirely destroyed or captured and no further resistance was to be expected from within.several battleships had escaped but there were thousands of war and merchant vessels under guard of thark warriors.the lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling among themselves so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could man as many vessels as possible with zodangan prisoners and make for helium without further loss of time.five hours later we sailed from the roofs of the dock buildings with a fleet of two hundred and fifty battleships carrying nearly one hundred thousand green warriors followed by a fleet of transports with our thoats.behind us we left the stricken city in the fierce and brutal clutches of some forty thousand green warriors of the lesser hordes.they were looting murdering and fighting amongst themselves.in a hundred places they had applied the torch and columns of dense smoke were rising above the city as though to blot out from the eye of heaven the horrid sights beneath.in the middle of the afternoon we sighted the scarlet and yellow towers of helium and a short time later a great fleet of zodangan battleships rose from the camps of the besiegers without the city and advanced to meet us.the twin cities of helium perceiving that we were friends sent out hundreds of vessels to aid us and then began the first real air battle i had ever witnessed.a wild cry of exultation arose from the heliumite squadron and with redoubled ferocity they fell upon the zodangan fleet.by a pretty maneuver two of the vessels of helium gained a position above their adversaries from which they poured upon them from their keel bomb batteries a perfect torrent of exploding bombs.then one by one the battleships of helium succeeded in rising above the zodangans and in a short time a number of the beleaguering battleships were drifting hopeless wrecks toward the high scarlet tower of greater helium.several others attempted to escape but they were soon surrounded by thousands of tiny individual fliers and above each hung a monster battleship of helium ready to drop boarding parties upon their decks.within but little more than an hour from the moment the victorious zodangan squadron had risen to meet us from the camp of the besiegers the battle was over and the remaining vessels of the conquered zodangans were headed toward the cities of helium under prize crews.not until the commander of the entire fleet took the fearful plunge thus indicating the surrender of the remaining vessels did the fighting cease and the useless sacrifice of brave men come to an end.as the full import of my announcement bore in upon them a great cry arose from the decks of the flagship and a moment later the colors of the princess of helium broke from a hundred points upon her upper works.when the other vessels of the squadron caught the meaning of the signals flashed them they took up the wild acclaim and unfurled her colors in the gleaming sunlight.the flagship bore down upon us and as she swung gracefully to and touched our side a dozen officers sprang upon our decks.as their astonished gaze fell upon the hundreds of green warriors who now came forth from the fighting shelters they stopped aghast but at sight of kantos kan who advanced to meet them they came forward crowding about him.dejah thoris and i then advanced and they had no eyes for other than her.she received them gracefully calling each by name for they were men high in the esteem and service of her grandfather and she knew them well.they were very courteous to me and said many kind and complimentary things but what seemed to impress them most was that i had won the aid of the fierce tharks in my campaign for the liberation of dejah thoris and the relief of helium.with the same polished courtesy that had marked their manner toward me they extended their greetings to the great thark nor to my surprise was he much behind them in ease of bearing or in courtly speech.though not a garrulous race the tharks are extremely formal and their ways lend themselves amazingly well to dignified and courtly manners.the commander of the naval forces of helium promised to arrange to have the armies of helium attack from the city in conjunction with our land attack and so the vessels separated and dejah thoris was borne in triumph back to the court of her grandfather tardos mors jeddak of helium.in the distance lay our fleet of transports with the thoats of the green warriors where they had remained during the battle.without landing stages it was to be a difficult matter to unload these beasts upon the open plain but there was nothing else for it and so we put out for a point about ten miles from the city and began the task.it was necessary to lower the animals to the ground in slings and this work occupied the remainder of the day and half the night.twice we were attacked by parties of zodangan cavalry but with little loss however and after darkness shut down they withdrew.as soon as the last thoat was unloaded tars tarkas gave the command to advance and in three parties we crept upon the zodangan camp from the north the south and the east.again tars tarkas ordered the charge and once more the mighty thoats bore their terrible riders against the ramparts of the enemy.at the same moment the battle line of helium surged over the opposite breastworks of the zodangans and in another moment they were being crushed as between two millstones.nobly they fought but in vain.the broad avenues were lined with women and children among which were the few men whose duties necessitated that they remain within the city during the battle.we were greeted with an endless round of applause and showered with ornaments of gold platinum silver and precious jewels.the city had gone mad with joy.my fierce tharks caused the wildest excitement and enthusiasm.never before had an armed body of green warriors entered the gates of helium and that they came now as friends and allies filled the red men with rejoicing.that my poor services to dejah thoris had become known to the heliumites was evidenced by the loud crying of my name and by the loads of ornaments that were fastened upon me and my huge thoat as we passed up the avenues to the palace for even in the face of the ferocious appearance of woola the populace pressed close about me.as we approached this magnificent pile we were met by a party of officers who greeted us warmly and requested that tars tarkas and his jeds with the jeddaks and jeds of his wild allies together with myself dismount and accompany them to receive from tardos mors an expression of his gratitude for our services.at the top of the great steps leading up to the main portals of the palace stood the royal party and as we reached the lower steps one of their number descended to meet us.the first member of our party he met was tars tarkas and his first words sealed forever the new friendship between the races.tardos mors then greeted each of the green jeddaks and jeds and to each spoke words of friendship and appreciation.as he approached me he laid both hands upon my shoulders.we were then presented to mors kajak jed of lesser helium and father of dejah thoris.he had followed close behind tardos mors and seemed even more affected by the meeting than had his father.he tried a dozen times to express his gratitude to me but his voice choked with emotion and he could not speak and yet he had as i was to later learn a reputation for ferocity and fearlessness as a fighter that was remarkable even upon warlike barsoom.in common with all helium he worshiped his daughter nor could he think of what she had escaped without deep emotion.for ten days the hordes of thark and their wild allies were feasted and entertained and then loaded with costly presents and escorted by ten thousand soldiers of helium commanded by mors kajak they started on the return journey to their own lands.the jed of lesser helium with a small party of nobles accompanied them all the way to thark to cement more closely the new bonds of peace and friendship.sola also accompanied tars tarkas her father who before all his chieftains had acknowledged her as his daughter.three weeks later mors kajak and his officers accompanied by tars tarkas and sola returned upon a battleship that had been dispatched to thark to fetch them in time for the ceremony which made dejah thoris and john carter one.for nine years i served in the councils and fought in the armies of helium as a prince of the house of tardos mors.the people seemed never to tire of heaping honors upon me and no day passed that did not bring some new proof of their love for my princess the incomparable dejah thoris.vivid in my memory is the picture of the last night as we sat there talking in low tones of the strange romance which had woven our lives together and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happiness and fulfill our hopes.flashing the signals which proclaimed it a dispatch bearer for the jeddak it circled impatiently awaiting the tardy patrol boat which must convoy it to the palace docks.ten minutes after it touched at the palace a message called me to the council chamber which i found filling with the members of that body.there was absolute silence for several minutes and then a young noble arose and with his drawn sword held high above his head addressed tardos mors.the chamber rang with applause and as there was nothing better to do than to allay the fears of the people by our example we went our ways with smiles upon our faces and sorrow gnawing at our hearts.when i returned to my palace i found that the rumor already had reached dejah thoris so i told her all that i had heard.the next two days brought no noticeable change in the supply of air but on the morning of the third day breathing became difficult at the higher altitudes of the rooftops.the avenues and plazas of helium were filled with people.all business had ceased.for the most part the people looked bravely into the face of their unalterable doom.here and there however men and women gave way to quiet grief.toward the middle of the day many of the weaker commenced to succumb and within an hour the people of barsoom were sinking by thousands into the unconsciousness which precedes death by asphyxiation.dejah thoris and i with the other members of the royal family had collected in a sunken garden within an inner courtyard of the palace.we conversed in low tones when we conversed at all as the awe of the grim shadow of death crept over us.even woola seemed to feel the weight of the impending calamity for he pressed close to dejah thoris and to me whining pitifully.the little incubator had been brought from the roof of our palace at request of dejah thoris and now she sat gazing longingly upon the unknown little life that now she would never know.he stooped and kissed the women of his family and laid his strong hand upon the shoulders of the men.as i turned sadly from him my eyes fell upon dejah thoris.her head was drooping upon her breast to all appearances she was lifeless.with a cry i sprang to her and raised her in my arms.her eyes opened and looked into mine.as i pressed her dear lips to mine the old feeling of unconquerable power and authority rose in me.the fighting blood of virginia sprang to life in my veins.turning suddenly toward tardos mors as i still clasped my dying love to my breast i cried.kissing dejah thoris a dozen times and commanding woola who would have followed me to remain and guard her i bounded with my old agility and strength to the high ramparts of the palace and in another moment i was headed toward the goal of the hopes of all barsoom.i had to fly low to get sufficient air to breathe but i took a straight course across an old sea bottom and so had to rise only a few feet above the ground.i traveled with awful velocity for my errand was a race against time with death.the face of dejah thoris hung always before me.as i turned for a last look as i left the palace garden i had seen her stagger and sink upon the ground beside the little incubator.that she had dropped into the last coma which would end in death if the air supply remained unreplenished i well knew and so throwing caution to the winds i flung overboard everything but the engine and compass even to my ornaments and lying on my belly along the deck with one hand on the steering wheel and the other pushing the speed lever to its last notch i split the thin air of dying mars with the speed of a meteor.an hour before dark the great walls of the atmosphere plant loomed suddenly before me and with a sickening thud i plunged to the ground before the small door which was withholding the spark of life from the inhabitants of an entire planet.conditions seemed much worse here than at helium and it was with difficulty that i breathed at all.there were a few men still conscious and to one of these i spoke.i had no time to talk i was becoming very weak and it was with difficulty that i controlled my mind at all.but with a final effort as i sank weakly to my knees i hurled the nine thought waves at that awful thing before me.the martian had crawled to my side and with staring eyes fixed on the single panel before us we waited in the silence of death.slowly the mighty door receded before us.i attempted to rise and follow it but i was too weak.from where i lay i opened the second door and then the third and as i saw the hope of barsoom crawling weakly on hands and knees through the last doorway i sank unconscious upon the ground.i felt myself over from head to foot and from head to foot i was clothed though when i fell unconscious at the little doorway i had been naked.before me was a small patch of moonlit sky which showed through a ragged aperture.as my hands passed over my body they came in contact with pockets and in one of these a small parcel of matches wrapped in oiled paper.one of these matches i struck and its dim flame lighted up what appeared to be a huge cave toward the back of which i discovered a strange still figure huddled over a tiny bench.as i approached it i saw that it was the dead and mummified remains of a little old woman with long black hair and the thing it leaned over was a small charcoal burner upon which rested a round copper vessel containing a small quantity of greenish powder.the sight that met my eyes as i stepped out upon a small ledge which ran before the entrance of the cave filled me with consternation.burying my head in my arms i turned broken and sorrowful down the trail from the cave.for ten years i have waited and prayed for an answer to my questions.for ten years i have waited and prayed to be taken back to the world of my lost love.i would rather lie dead beside her there than live on earth all those millions of terrible miles from her.as i sit here tonight in my little study overlooking the hudson just twenty years have elapsed since i first opened my eyes upon mars.i believe that they are waiting there for me and something tells me that i shall soon know.states.damage.warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.
