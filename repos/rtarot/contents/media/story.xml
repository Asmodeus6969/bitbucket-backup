"'Wretched boy!' she said, hoarsely and scornfully, and clenching her hand, 'Take then the doom of your own choice!  Bow down your miserable head and let a mother's--'

"Meantime Horace had fallen on his knees, at her feet, and hid his, face in his hands.

"Who then, is she--who!  Truly his 'guardian spirit' hath stepped between him and the fearful words, which, however unmerited, must have hung as a pall over his future existence;--a spell which could not be unbound--which could not be unsaid.

"Of an earthly paleness, but calm with the still, iron-bound calmness of death--the only calm one there--Katherine stood; and her words smote on the ear in tones whose appallingly slow and separate intonation rung on the heart like a chill, isolated tolling of some fatal knell.

"'He would have plighted me his faith, but I did not accept it; you cannot, therefore--you dare not curse him.  And here,' she continued, raising her hand to heaven, whither her large dark eyes also rose with a chastened glow, which, for the first time, suffering had lighted in those passionate orbs--'here I promise, come weal, come woe, that Horace Wolchorley and I do never interchange vows without his mother's sanction--without his mother's blessing!'"
