This is a sample project suitable for beginning a Polycode project from. It starts with a space populated with shapes from an SVG, and a console into which LUA commands can be typed. I suggest trying entering the Polycode LUA examples.

This will hopefully be expanded with time to support platforms other than mac.

Before compiling for the first time, run:
 
./manage.py install

You will need mercurial installed for this to work right.
