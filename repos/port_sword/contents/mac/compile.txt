THINGS I DID TO MAKE THIS COMPILE

- install libpng 1.2
- build SDL_Project.xcodeproj in release mode
- copy the following files into the directory with .app:
	- sword.cfg
	- terminal.png
	- gfx
	- rooms
	- text.txt
	- README.TXT
	- mac/README_MAC.TXT
- Set full = false in sword.cfg
- Renamed SDL_Project.app to Sword In Hand.app

Thanks to #macdev for help
