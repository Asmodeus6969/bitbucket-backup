# Emily-game

This is a fork of the Emily programming language repo for purposes of making a video game with embedded Emily interpreter. There is a substantial loss of generality involved. (At some point it would be better to build the Emily interpreter as a shared library and load that into a game, but as of this writing that creates difficulties with the OCaml build tools.)

To build, run

    make

To run, run `./install/emily`.
