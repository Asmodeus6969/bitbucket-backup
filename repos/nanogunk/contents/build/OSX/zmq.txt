# This script allows libzmq to be build universal for 32/64 bit (Intel only)

# example usage, assuming libzmq is in ~/p/libzmq, and ufo in ~/p/ufo
cd ~/p/libzmq
. ~/p/ufo/etc/zmq-osx-configure.sh

# The actual generated .dylib file is manually copied to ~/p/ufo/bin
# This should be automated
