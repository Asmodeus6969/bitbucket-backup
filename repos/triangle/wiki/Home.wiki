== Introduction ==

This is the source code to an **unfinished** game provisionally called "L?L?L?L", created by [[http://runhello.com/|Run Hello]]. Included are the Mac, Windows, and Linux versions.

The project is hosted here on Bitbucket, so you can download the source yourself by doing one of the following:

* {{{hg clone https://bitbucket.org/runhello/triangle}}}
* {{{svn co https://bitbucket.org/runhello/triangle/trunk}}}
* Select the "download repository" link from the [[https://bitbucket.org/runhello/triangle/downloads|downloads page]].

== How to use ==

Before compiling, you will need to build Polycode. You can do this by running {{{./manage.py load -b -d --bindings-only --no-tools}}} from the repository root. Once you have done this, to compile:

* For Mac, run ./package/pkg_mac.sh
* For Windows, enter ./package/win and perform make (you will need MinGW).
* For Linux, enter ./package/lin and perform make.

For more detailed instructions on building both Polycode and this project, see the help for [[https://bitbucket.org/runhello/polyconsole|Polyconsole]].
